Classes:
    base class requires virtual destructor
    func() override; for virtual overiding base class
    func() noexcept; iff function will never throw

Keywords:
    nullptr (prefer over NULL, due to type)
    func()=delete (prefer over blank declaration)
    enum class Name { (prefer over enum Name)
    constexp (variable that is constant and known at compilation)
    constexp (function return compile time constants (has special rules for declaration)
